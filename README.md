# Provisional-Death-Count

# Introduction
The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced.
I collected other respiratory disease death rates to see the impact COVID-19 is threatening our lives by comparing with other disease death rates 
and chose the States with high COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Influenza mortality rate, 
which are California, Massachusetts,New Jersey, New York, New York City, Pennsylvania
I would like to compare death rate of these disease death rate by age, race, and sex 
and want to find any interest in a relationship between those respiratory diseases according to the provisional respiratory death counts datasets. 


# Conclusion
Pneumonia death has a relationship with Covid-19 death. That is, we can deduce that pneumonia has an impact on Covid-19. 
However, influenza death does not have any relationship with Covid-19 death.
The projection  is based on if the current preventions (such as, at least 6 feet distance, face covering, and hand washing) are done. 
The numbers look good for all the states; however, Pennsylvania needs to be careful with the  various high and low points on their plot.
